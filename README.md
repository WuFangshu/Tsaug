# thermal-comfort-synthetic

synthetic data for thermal comfort modelling  

This code explores the use of **synthetic data generation** to support the training of deep learning models for assessing and predicting **thermal comfort** in vehicles and buildings.

Instead of relying solely on costly and time-consuming user evaluations, we generate augmented datasets from the **AutoTherm** dataset using time series augmentation techniques (`tsaug`) to pretrain and improve models such as **LSTM** and **xLSTM**.
